Using a Phoenix Dive after using a Healing Grenade will refresh its duration to 4+2 seconds.
Empyrean and Mercy are both duration extenders, and do not count as reapplying Restoration. Extending a Solar Effect that is at >15 seconds will set it to 15 seconds.

Ignitions remove all Scorch, and incur a 1.6 second cooldown before Scorch can be reapplied.

### Solar Effect

*Damage Scaling*

Solar Effect (Scorch | Ignition) damage can be increased through Perks and Exotics, but the source used for initially scorching will determine what it will be counted as.
Inflicting a Solar Effect with a Weapon, such as with Incandescent/Burning Ambition or through Exotic Weapons such as Tommy's Matchbook or Conditional Finality, will result in Solar Effects counting as Weapon Damage, benefitting from Weapon Buffs and Activity Modifiers that exclusively benefit Weapons, such as other Damage Perks, Weapon Stat, Radiant, and Solar Weapon Surges.
New Gear Bonus is applied permanently to all Weapons, so all Solar Effect Damage against Combatants will always be 5% higher than expected, on top of Combatant Rank Scalars.
Inflicting Solar Effects through abilities such as Fusion Grenades and Well of Radiance will result in the Solar Effects counting as Solar Ability Damage, with their damage only being increased by Grenade (Verity's Brow), and Super (Heart of the Flame) Damage Increases respectively. Melee Damage Buffs and 100+ Melee Stat do not increase Solar Effect Damage.
Effects that increase all Ability Damage will benefit all Solar Effects that are initially applied through Solar Abilities.
Activity Modifiers that increase all Solar Damage, such as Solar Surge, will also apply to Solar Effects, regardless of source.
