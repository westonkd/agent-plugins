- **Ability Tiers** — Ability Energy Generation

Ability Chunk Energy Gains are generally defined by the base cooldowns of all Abilities, including Class, Grenade, Melee, and Super Abilities.
Season of the Wish altered how effects that give a chunk % of your Ability Energy, such as Demolitionist, Bomber, Dynamo, and Momentum Transfer, interact with Chunk Scalars.
Supers do not experience Chunk Modifiers, although most Roaming Supers receive more energy from dealing damage.
Chunk Scalars modify the %-based Energy Gains, down to x0.5 for Grenade and Class Abilities, and 0.6x for Melee Abilities.
Unless explicitly stated, or if an Exotic interacts specifically with a listed Ability, all Ability Energy Gains are affected by Chunk Energy Scaling.

- **Combatant Classification** — Combatant Classification
## Combatant Tiers

Combatants are divided into 4 different tiers. Each tier groups enemies within a certain range of Health.
Elite Combatants have their Tier increased by +1 compared to their Rank-and-File equivalent.
E.g: Psion (Tier 1) -> Elite Psion (Tier 2)
Vandal (Tier 2) -> Elite Vandal (Tier 3)
Champions, Minibosses, and Bosses are exempt from the Tier System, and will count as either the highest possible Tier, or have their own specific classification.
Combatant Tiers affect the Ability Energy Gains and Effect Triggers, such as the Weapon Perks Headstone and Unrelenting, Fragments such as Ember of Searing and Whisper of Refraction, Exotics, like Vex Mythoclast and Promethium Spur, as well as certain Armor Mods.

Combatant Tiers =/= Combatant Ranks
Combatant Tiers are a classification used for effects that scale based on how strong an enemy is, such as for Devour's Grenade Energy Gains.
Combatant Ranks affect the Tier System:
Elite Combatants are granted +1 Tier over their RnF equivalent.
Minibosses, Tormentors, Champions are placed at Tier 5.
Bosses are placed at Tier 6.
Examples:
Rank-and-File Vandal (T2) -> Elite Vandal (T3)
Rank-and-File Captain (T3) -> Elite Captain (T4) -> Overload Champion (T5)
For effects that don't have an established value for Tier 4–6, their next highest value is instead used. Vehicles are wildly inconsistent.
Examples:
Point-Contact Cannon Brace has Tiers 1–6, so every Combatant Tier works for it.
Devour has Tiers 1–4, so Minibosses and Bosses will be treated as T4 for it.

- **Tier 2 Combatant** — Incendior Legionary Phalanx | Marauder Vandal | Acolyte | Harpy Hobgoblin Goblin | Acolyte Goblin Hobgoblin Phalanx Vandal | Lurker Raider | Husk
- **Tier 3 Combatant** — Centurion Gladiator | Captain | Knight Wizard | Minotaur | Captain Centurion Knight Minotaur Wizard | Chieftain Wraith
- **Tier 4 Combatant** — Colossus | Brig Heavy Shank Servitor | Shrieker Ogre | Cyclops Hydra Wyvern | Ogre | Abomination | Subjugator Tormentors Omen

## Heat Weapons

Weapons with the intrinsic Heat Weapon trait uniquely generate Heat as they fire, using Ammo directly from reserves instead of utilizing regular magazines.
Heat Weapons can manually vent Heat at a Vent Speed-based rate instead of reloading, triggering On-Reload effects. Manual Vent can be cancelled at any point.
Heat Gauge ranges from 0 Heat to 1000 Heat, represented in game with 2 different values.
Heat Generated and Cooling Efficiency work in the 0-1000 range wherein each point counts as 0.1% Heat, while the in-game magazine displays the Heat%.
Each shot generates Heat equal to the Heat Generated stat, while Cooling Efficiency is the amount of Heat passively dissipated every second.
Exceeding 1000 Heat forcefully triggers an Overheated Manual Vent.
Overheated Manual Vent renders the weapon unusable until it reaches ≤150 Heat. Overheated Weapons have instantaneous stow.
Heat Weapons deal 15% Increased Impact Damage to Elite+ Combatants.
Dynamic Heat Weapons intrinsically deal 15% [2.5%] Increased Impact Damage that multiplicatively stacks with the aforementioned increase.
